# Database_Management_Term_Project
Final submission for Database Management Systems Term Project.

This was a semester long group project which involved reading a business case, creating an ER Diagram and Functional Dependency Diagram based on the business case, editiing the diagrams through first, second, and third normal form, creating a databse in Oracle SQL Developer, and quering the database.

This was my first project with SQL and it served as my introduction to databases. This project was highly collaborative and was done with the help of 3 other team members.
